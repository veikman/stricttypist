## Stricttypist

This package provides a trivial terminal-based typing tutor.

Stricttypist is not a fully featured touch typing tutor and does not measure
performance in any way. It is intended to complement similar software by
focusing on one small aspect of the learning experience: Immediately informing
the user about the nature of any mistakes.

The program was developed because its sole feature was absent from gtypist and
various popular online services when the project began. The author felt the
need for it in transitioning from QWERTY to Colemak.
